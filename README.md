# SolidJS, Flowbite and Typescript Starter Template

solidjs-flowbite-typescript

This project adds [Flowbite](https://flowbite.com/) UI components to the SolidJS template [ts-tailwindcss](https://github.com/solidjs/templates/tree/main/ts-tailwindcss).

Currently it has one example component (src/components/Alert). The implementation is simple but adequate for my needs. I will be building a project using and and will and enhancements as I progress.
